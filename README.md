# (a) Bunch Of Small Programs

`bosp` is a small portal of utilities for developers that would otherwise need to create on their own or use (and trust) fromsomeone else.

What's the difference to having a bunch of tabs? That this toolkit is free to fork from Github so you can change whaterver you want: from removing tools to just changing the font style. It is designed to be used as is or to be modified at pleasure, growing to the needs.

It uses the [WONDERFUL SvelteKit framework](https://kit.svelte.dev) and, alongside their own vision for the project, pretends to be as minimal in code as possible.

After all,

Since I had no real time (or ideas, tbh) to continue this project, I forgot a lot about it. So now that I have things I want to keep at hand, making this project useful again, I will continue it little by little.

First things first: Node 12+ is required. I'm using Node 22 as its the current alive version. 

There are some error the linter is throwing, but so far I've yet to see any actual error. I will also try to work on making some sort of framework to implement stuff easier, but as of now the page + brains concept is working, so that's that.
