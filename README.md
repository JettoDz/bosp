#(a) Bunch Of Small Programs

`bosp` is a small portal of utilities for developers that would otherwise need to create on their own or use (and trust) fromsomeone else.

What's the difference to having a bunch of tabs? That this toolkit is free to fork from Github so you can change whaterver you want: from removing tools to just changing the font style. It is designed to be used as is or to be modified at pleasure, growing to the needs.

It uses the [WONDERFUL SvelteKit framework](https://kit.svelte.dev) and, alongside their own vision for the project, pretends to be as minimal in code as possible.

After all,
